## My process

### Built with

- HTML

- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In completing this challenge, I learned how to:

- shadow, *e.g.,*
```css
.payment-btn {
  box-shadow: 0 1rem 1rem $pale-blue;
}
```

- place elements on top of (or underneath) other elements using `position: relatve` and `z-index`, *e.g.,*
```css
.payment-btn {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

.cancel-btn {
  position: relative;
}
```

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [mdn web docs: box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This is where I learned how to add a box-shadow to an element.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
